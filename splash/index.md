Welcome to Keith Buhler.com. I am a philosopher and classical educator. 

My life's work is to help people in and out of the classroom by teaching, coaching, and modeling the practical skills that bring about human flourishing. The goal of human life is the cultivation of love and wisdom. Achieving this goal in your particular circumstances requires identifying and fighting the many vices that so easily entangle, and pursuing the virtues in daily life.

My philosophical research centers on virtue ethics, the philosophy of religion, and naturalism. My first book was a [Platonic dialogue about Scripture and Tradition.](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) The second is a philosophy dissertation about contemporary forms of Aristotle's virtue ethics. It is titled [Becoming What We Are](/phd).
