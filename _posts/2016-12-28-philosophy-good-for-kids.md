File this under "Things That Shouldn't Be Surprising."

A recent study by the Education Endowment Foundation found that [disadvantaged kids perform better in STEM fields after 2 years of studying philosophy.](http://qz.com/635002/teaching-kids-philosophy-makes-them-smarter-in-math-and-english/)

3,000 school children discussed philosophical concepts, reflected, and practiced dialogging. Their test scores improved in a way that appears to reflect lasting change. 

So, it turns out, the notion of [philosophy corrupting the youth](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html) was fake news.
