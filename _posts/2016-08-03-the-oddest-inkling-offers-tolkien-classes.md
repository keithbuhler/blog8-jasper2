If you are a Inklings geek like I am, [Signum University](http://www.signumuniversity.org/) is an exciting place I've been reading about. 

They not only have an online school called ["Mythgard"](https://theoddestinkling.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/mythgard-the-gateway-drug/), the mere name of which fires the imagination, but they offer an M.A. Literature program in which one can concentrate on [Tolkien studies(!)](https://theoddestinkling.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/news-flash-signum-classes-and-a-book/)

SÃ¸rina Higgins is a very cool scholar and poet who heads up the program. She not only teaches C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and J.R.R. Tolkien but she workshops fiction as part of her duties as department chair. [Her interpretation of Lewis' concept of "joy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys4kLCtXvNY) is so persuasive I am assigning my C.S. Lewis students to listen to it the first week of class. 

I don't know how many of you are looking for an online MA in literature, but this is a unique opportunity to check out.
