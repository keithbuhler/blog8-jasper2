I love English. Sure, English is impossibly inconsistant on the surface, but its rules are there -- they are deep and hidden. Rather than saying English is nonsensical, its safer to say that one must speak English with devotion for decades to understand its secrets. As an example: Take the prepositional phrase, "get on." What does that mean? 

Let me tell you a story about Al Capone: 

### How Al Capone Got On

As a child, Al Capone __got on__ the bus every day to go to school. 

His mom __got on__ him about his grades, so he worked hard. 

He even __got on__ student government. 

As an adult, he __got on__ with everyone... except the law.

He eventually __got on__ the police's "Public enemy" list.

They __got him on__ tax evasion. 

He almost __got off__ in appeals court, but spent 11 years in prison.

He didn't leave prison until he after he __got on__ a guerney.
