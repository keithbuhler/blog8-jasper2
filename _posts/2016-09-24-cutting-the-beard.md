In October 2015, I stopped cutting my beard. The reason, of course, is that [hair is the organ of extrasensory perception, duh.](https://www.sott.net/article/234783-The-Truth-About-Hair-and-Why-Indians-Would-Keep-Their-Hair-Long) I told Lindsay I would grow it out until the dissertation was done. If some job interviews came in, I would certainly trim it back.

It grew wild and fierce and free. I trimmed here and there but mostly enjoyed the homeless-status-symbol. 

The dissertation is now done. The defense is about a month away. I'm thinking that I should go big or go home. That means two things: 

1. Cut into a fun shape for a few days.
2. Shave completely after the defense.
3. Grow it out again for Movember. 
4. Trim to sensible levels in December and maintain. 

This is where you come in. What fun shape should I cut into? Suggestions welcome...
