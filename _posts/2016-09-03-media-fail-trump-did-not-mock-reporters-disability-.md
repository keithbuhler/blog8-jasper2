Turns out Trump did not mock that reporter's disability. 

Sure, Trump has lots of flaws, but it seems *this one* was made up by the outrage machine. Trump mocked a reporter for backing down from his own reporting; but he did not mock a disabled guy's *disability*. [Check it out.](http://www.catholics4trump.com/the-true-story-donald-trump-did-not-mock-a-reporters-disability/) 

He did mock a disabled reporter, which is bad enough. But he didn't mock his disability in particular. Trump mocks men, women, Americans, foreigners, Christians, Muslims, veterens, civilians, politicians, businessmen. He is a mocker. 

You might say, "Oh well he's still evil." Fine fine, you can still hate 'em for everything else, but good luck hating 'em for this one. Turns out it was a case of "We are outraged at Trump, find a reason! Anything will do!" As one friend told me, it makes you wonder what else the media is lying about. 

One complaint against Trump is that *he mocks anyone at all.* It's unprofessional, impolite, crude, vulgar, and so on. That is a valid criticism. It's different, however, from the accusation that he targets the weak, vulnerable, or voiceless. He criticizes media, politics, and entertainment professionals with a platform to strike back: Megyn Kelly, John McCain, Rosie O'Donnell, Obama, Hilary -- and Serge.
