<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQIuTGfPHvA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> This is my first time watching a Comic Book Girl video, but everything she says about the new Ghostbusters seems reasonable to me. 

Also, [that hair.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQIuTGfPHvA)

Disclaimers: 

(a) I haven't seen the new one (but plan to). 

(b) I liked the originals but they are not in my top 10 or top 50. 

Was not an enormous fan of original Ghostbusters. Not that I *didn't* like it, but I was a little young for it. Never watched 'em more than twice. Ranks up there with, maybe *Speed* as a movie I enjoyed but did not see more than once or twice. So I don't have a lot invested in a remake. 

To me the trailer for the new one looked... meh. The brouhaha over the movie interests me though.

UPDATE I: 

I'm watching, and very much enjoying, Ghostbusters (1984). After that, the sequel!


UPDATE II: 

[Comic Book Girl did a FOLLOW-UP video here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn_vAcFGTJU) explaining why it's important to be honest.

Best line: "I need to see people having fun doing this, pushing the boundaries of art... Making me think about things. See the world in different ways. And expanding my consciousness. That's what I use movies for. It's not just about escapism. It's also about refining one's soul through the process of viewing art."
