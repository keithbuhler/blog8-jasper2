Media companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter are realizing their Silicon Valley left-leaning [liberal privilege](http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/04/15/15-examples-of-liberal-privilege-n1824468). 

While [Twitter is doubling-down](http://www.wnd.com/2016/08/twitter-stock-plunges-as-conservatives-purged/), Facebook and [Google](http://www.keithbuhler.com/buhlerreport/politics/2016/12/08/conservative-worldview-google-hiring-outreach.html) at least are trying to strike a new balance. 

General rule of thumb (for conservatives): if [Huffington Post freaks out at your hiring decision](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campbell-brown-facebook_us_586fd293e4b099cdb0fcea5d?section=us_politics), you're doing it right. (For progressives: if [Breitbart freaks out at your hiring decision](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/26/target-hired-former-la-raza-exec-board-member/), then you're doing it right.)

Facebook hires a centrist Democrat who isn't a flaming [firebrand](http://amzn.to/2j0FOQf) and HuffPo headlines her "deep Republican ties." Not that she is a Republican, mind you, but she has "ties." 

Be careful or you'll hire someone with deep ties to the same [center-right America](http://www.gallup.com/poll/167144/wyoming-residents-conservative-liberal.aspx) which has been, and is [likely to remain](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/america-not-moving-left-213095), the core of American culture. 

Which do you think media and social media companies should do to understand and represent all the intellectual diversity in the nation? 

(a) Hire a token conservative  
(b) Hire an "expert" who studies conservatism but may not be conservative
