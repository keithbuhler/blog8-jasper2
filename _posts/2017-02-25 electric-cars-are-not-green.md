[As it turns out, electric cars cost roughly the same as gas cars in C02.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17xh_VRrnMU) They are no greener than regular cars but are hugely more expensive in public dollars. 

This is sad, if true, but we must acknowledge inconvenient truths. 

That said, I still want a Tesla but mostly for two reasons: 

1. They are cool, and
2. They are state subsidized so *your* taxes are going to help me pay for it!
