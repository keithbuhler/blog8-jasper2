>“Verily verily, I say to you, there will come a time when every interesting quotation will be ascribed to me. Do not believe it.”

-Albert Einstein

Much like the piano song "Fur Elise" is attributed to [Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4GcsUN7hlc) or [Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGb-1ubXZ_Y) (and occasionally Beethoven), every mildly interesting quotation has at some time been [ascribed to Einstein.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/misattributed-to-einstein)

Call it Einstein's Law: The more a sentence is witty, wonderous, cute, and slightly smart, the more likely it will eventually be ascribed to Einstein."
