Peter Kreeft is a hero of mine not only for his funny lectures and crystal clear arguments but for making philosophy accessible. 

His [new book](https://www.amazon.com/Socrates-Children-Ancient-Greatest-Philosophers/dp/1587317834/theofficiapet-20) coming out promises to be a winner. It's the kind of introduction to philosophy that is philosophical in form and content.
