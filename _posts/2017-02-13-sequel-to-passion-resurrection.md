Randall Wallace is writing a sequel to *The Passion.* It will be called ["The Resurrection."](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mel-gibsons-passion-christ-sequel-titled-resurrection-943363) Gibson anticipates it to be ["three years off."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65DHhobPw0)

(In an earlier article, [Mark Joseph](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christian-filmmaker-faith-based-is-805815) explains why "faith-based" film is not a thing.)
