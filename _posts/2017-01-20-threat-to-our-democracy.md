### Threat to our Democracy 

Groups like #DisruptJ20 and the coalitions they represent are a direct threat to our democracy. They reject [a peaceful transition](http://www.disruptj20.org/event/disruptj20-protest-the-inauguration-of-donald-trump/). They reject civil disobedience. They want to break the law. They are not Democrats or progressives. They are anarchists.

### Whoops, Now We're Felons

[CBS News Reports that more than 200 inauguration day protesters are being charged with felony rioting.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inauguration-day-protests-felony-rioting-charges-federal-prosecutors-say/) Whoops.

### DisruptJ20's Email Follow Up Begs for Money

>Trump's inauguration was met with the most militant, diverse protests DC has seen in over a decade, with blockades that shut down more than half of the security checkpoints and multiple massive marches, both permitted and unpermitted, taking the streets.

>More than 100 of our comrades were swept up in a mass arrest, many teargassed and pepper sprayed before spending the night in jail. Please donate generously to support those who put their bodies on the line.

Notice the language: "our comrades" were arrested. Not "our comrades committed felonies and were brought to justice."
