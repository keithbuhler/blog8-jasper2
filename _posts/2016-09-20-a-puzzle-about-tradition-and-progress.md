A philosophical puzzle for you: 

Set up: 

- Alan and Alex believe P.  
- Bettie and Bob believe Q. 
- All four of them examine their beliefs through rational reflection. 

Results: 

<!--more-->

- Alan cannot justify P, but finds rational proof of Q, so changes his mind to Q. 
- Alex can justify P with rational proof, so continues to believe P. 
- Bettie cannot justify Q, but finds rational proof for P, so changes her mind to P. 
- Bob can justify Q with rational proof, so continues to believe Q. 

Analysis: 

- Alan changes his mind to agree with Bob. 
- Bettie changes her mind to agree with Alex. 
- Both Alex and Bob do not change their mind, and continue to disagree. 
- All four have some rational justification for their belief.

Questions: 

- Which, if any, is a subversive or progressive? Alan and Bettie?
- Which, if any, is a traditionalist or conservative? Alex and Bob?
- Which, if any, is open-minded? All of them? 
- Which, if any, is close-minded? All of them? 

Meta-Question: 

Do you need to know the content of P and Q before answering these questions? Is there anyway to define a traditionalist apart from the content of the tradition? 

Is there any way to define a revolutionary apart from the content of the revolution?
