I'd like to write a philosophy book one day trying to show that a very tiny minority of arguments validly derive their conclusion from true premises. 

Working title: Petitio or Non-Sequitur. 

The thesis would be simply this: 

1. Most philosophical or rational arguments beg the question, placing a modified version of the conclusion somewhere in the premises; and
2. Most scientific or empirical arguments commit a non sequitur, merely asserting a new conclusion ex nihilo after detailing true but ultimately unrelated premises. 

I'm not sure if this these warrants a whole book, because now that I've said it -- that's pretty much the whole book.
