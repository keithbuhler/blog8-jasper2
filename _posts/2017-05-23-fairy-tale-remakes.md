You know all those new fairy remakes or satires that keep coming out? From Wicked, to Malevolent, to Shrek, etc. etc? 

They all have a unifying premise. Let me break it down it for you: 

Classic tale: Once upon a time there was a hero who was good, and a villain who was evil. The hero defeated the villain; good conquered evil. 

Remake: It turns out the villain wasn't really evil, just misunderstood. In fact, the villain was abused by someone else once. The villain is actually a victim, so it makes sense that he or she would act out. As a matter of fact, maybe the non-empathetic "hero" was actually evil for misunderstanding and killing the villain.

The end.
