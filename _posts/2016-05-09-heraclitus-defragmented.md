The original [Fragments of Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus#Logos) are powerful and puzzling. No one is sure of the original or meaning. No one is sure of the original order, context, and complete set. Hence, *any* presentation of the fragments, must make choices. Any choice will present some, not others, in a particular order, and thus will interpret Heraclitus. 

Since interpretation is inevitable, each editor will interpret, and each reader will interpret; this interpretive effort is usually reserved and cautious. I thought it would be interesting exercise to go whole hog. In this interpretation I have freely interpreted the fragments we have in order to construct a (purely hypothetical) coherent unity. The result is quite obviously *not* a reconstruction of "Heraclitus," but a kind of "found poem" of my own using Heraclitian fragments as raw material. The result is an original poem. It "flows" in a way certainly unlike Heraclitus' original, but offers a look at what a coherent version of Heraclitus' fragments *might* have looked like.
