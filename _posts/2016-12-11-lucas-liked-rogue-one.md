[Lucas liked Rogue One.](http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/is-the-force-with-rogue-one-george-lucas-gives-his-verdict-on-latest-star-wars-20161204-gt3v2m.html) I'm keeping my expectations low because the trailers don't excite me as much as I hoped. Worst case scenario, Lucas approval might mean that Rogue One somehow resembles Episode I more than VII. I doubt it, but it's worth mentioning.

For the director, Gareth Edwards, having Lucas' approval is not a necessity, but it's certainly nice. After all, Lucas is the God of Star Wars.
