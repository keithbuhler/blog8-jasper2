I feel so proud. Someone on the internet disagrees with me. 

Some of you know I [self-published a book](https://www.amazon.com/Sola-Scriptura-Dialogue-Keith-Buhler/dp/1475270860/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1471485271&sr=8-12&keywords=sola+scriptura) 4 years ago. Mostly friends and family have read it, but I do get about 1 sale per month. God knows who is reading it and what they think.

Today, I got my first random email from a Polish reader who read my book and wanted to complain about a few things. He had some insightful comments and a pugnacious challenge. All good things.

Someone on the Internet disagrees with me! Is this what it feels like to arrive?
