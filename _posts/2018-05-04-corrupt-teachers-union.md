It's horrifying to hear Dr. David Perry, the President of the Hamilton Township Education Association, say this:

"I’m not here to hurt anybody. I’m here to defend. No matter the worst teachers in the world, I have defended."

Teachers should not be invincible to accountability. On the contrary, they should be *more* accountable than many other professionals. 

We teachers are accountable to the parents, to our students, to our administrators, to the law, and to truth itself.
