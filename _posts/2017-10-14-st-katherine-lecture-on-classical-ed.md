Join me at the University of St. Katherine on Monday, 7:30pm, where I'll be speaking to the students about classical education as a form of initiation into a life of virtue and the pursuit of wisdom.

This is an extra special visit for me, since the last time I visited St Katherine it was just "St. Katherine College" and Lindsay was on the admissions team. I'm glad to see the work God has done growing and building the school.
