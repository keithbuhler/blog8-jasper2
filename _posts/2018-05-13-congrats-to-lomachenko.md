There was a big fight tonight... Congratulations are in order to Ukraine and to its champion boxer, Lomachenko. 

[Enjoy the highlights at CBS](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/vasyl-lomachenko-tkos-jorge-linares-to-become-fastest-three-division-boxing-champion/). 

It was a beautiful fight. English has its Alexander Pope, tennis has its Roger Federer, boxing has its Vasyl Lomachenko. 

[Back in 2017, I wrote about this Orthodox Christian boxer, praising the musicality of his performances.](http://www.keithbuhler.com/culture/2017/09/14/lomachenko.html) He is a musician as much as a boxer. Rhythm, rhyme, repetition, syncopation. It's beautiful to watch. 

On May 11, I mentioned that the fight was coming up and predicted that "take down his next opponent and become a three-weight-class world champion. His fighting style is, as of now, unstoppable." Although Lomachenko got knocked down in the sixth round he showed class by thanking Linares for teaching him a lesson. 

He also showed his humility by giving credit to his father and trainer saying, "My father told me to go for the body in the final rounds, so I did."
